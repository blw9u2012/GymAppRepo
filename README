A simple gym checkin android application thats for the AFC. We connected our android application to the mysql database on the dbm2.itc.virginia.edu
server. The one that was provided for the database system class didn't seem to want to connect properly which is mentioned in out documentation.
It kept giving the warning that we had to upgrade our mysql client and stated that it wasn't able to connect.
